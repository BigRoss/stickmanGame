# stickmanGame
A small game used to practice object oriented design patterns. Design patterns used include proxy, singleton, builder, and state.
The controls are the arrow keys to move. Space bar to jump. P to pause. 
C to activate god-mode which will prevent the user from dying from colliding with obstacles. 
Player can collect different types of power-ups and will hold onto them until the next stage or until death. If another
powerup is picked up then the user will hold that instead.

Use the config file to change positions of obstacles and to toggle other information such as the stickmans starting position
and the gravity value.
